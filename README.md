This is a project about a web application for a transport company

DOMAIN AREA
Vehicle Leasing and Transportation
PROBLEM DEFINITION:
The traditional method of leasing vehicles involves clients contacting the transport company to request a vehicle, after which the company manually manages the booking and delivery process.

WHY VEHICLE LEASING IS THE DOMAIN AREA
Currently, many vehicle leasing companies rely on manual or outdated systems for managing bookings, payments and vehicle availability. These leads to several challenges such as:
Time Consuming: Clients must contact the company directly to check availability and book vehicles resulting in longer wait times.
Lack of Real-Time Data: Companies cannot easily track vehicle locations, availability or client requests, causing delays and miscommunication.
Inefficient Coordination: Managing vehicle dispatch and service provision manually leads to inefficiencies, especially when there are multiple clients and vehicles.

SOLUTIONS THAT THE FUEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE
Increased Efficiency: Automating the booking process reduces the time and effort of both the client and the company improving service delivery.
Data Accuracy: By handling booking information digitally, the system minimizes the risk of human error associated with manual data entry.
Real-Time Vehicle Tracking: GPS integration allows clients and the company to track vehicle locations and estimated arrival times in real time.
Geographical Reach: By taking the process online, the company can reach clients in geographically scattered areas without needing them to visit the office
Real-Time Data Access: The system will provide real time access to data allowing directors and managers to monitor sales, inventory levels and employee performance instantly from any location

SERVER
The system utilizes the WAMP server to host the online vehicle leasing platform. WAMP is the ideal choice for this project due to the following reasons:
Local Development Environment: WAMP allows the system to be developed and tested locally on Windows, which is useful for building and testing the vehicle leasing application before deploying it live.
MySQL Integration: WAMP includes MySQL database. This will allow the system to store and retrieve data such as vehicle bookings, client details, and feedback effectively.
PHP Compatibility: The vehicle leasing system will rely on PHP for server side logic and dynamic content delivery making WAMP  a perfect fit since it supports PHP natively.
